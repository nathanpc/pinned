# Pinned

[Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) client for hackers.


## Installation

The installation process is extremely easy and you won't have any problems with dependencies, since there are almost no dependencies, the only one is [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/).

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/nathanpc/pinned.git
$ cd pinned
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
